# spreadsheetAPItest

This is just revisiting a intructional video I made on using the spreadsheet api here:

I am trouble shooting what still works and doesn't work and making this available to other to do the same.

1 `npm i`


2 `npm start` and then go to 


3 `localhost:3000` in your browser 


Open up your console log and it should be printing data from my spread sheet like the title of the tab,
my email address and username from the spreadsheet but no data from the content of the cells.
This probably make it useless. Not sure what changed but explore folloing the instruction on
doing this via the official google API.

Feel free to use this and switch out values and see if anything works for you and let me know.
